> Note: you can also use a `rebase` if you are familiar with this command.

The goal of this PR is to:

- [ ] Use the prefect library to adapt the code developed in the PR2 to use `flow` and `task` objects

Files to be modified: the `src/modelling` folder

- [ ] Don't forget to update the `requirements.in` file with the new dependencies (and compile it to generate the `requirements.txt` file)
- [ ] Don't forget to update the `README.md` file with the new steps to reproduce to run the code
- [ ] You should among other add instructions to run the prefect UI and visualize the flow runs
